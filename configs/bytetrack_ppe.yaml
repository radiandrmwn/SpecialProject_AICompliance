# Custom ByteTrack Configuration for PPE Detection
# Optimized for handling occlusion (people getting close to each other)

tracker_type: bytetrack  # Tracker type

# Track buffer parameters
track_high_thresh: 0.5  # High confidence threshold for track initiation
track_low_thresh: 0.1   # Low confidence threshold for track recovery (LOWER = better occlusion handling)
new_track_thresh: 0.6   # Threshold for creating new tracks (HIGHER = less likely to create new IDs)
track_buffer: 60        # Number of frames to keep lost tracks (HIGHER = better for occlusion)
match_thresh: 0.8       # Matching threshold for association (LOWER = more permissive matching)

# Frame rate (will be auto-detected from video)
frame_rate: 30
